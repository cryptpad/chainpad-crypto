# ChainPad-Crypto

This repository is somewhat poorly named since its scope has increased considerably since it was first created.
Basically it implements various encryption methods for use within [CryptPad](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad).

Unfortunately at this point you'll need to read the code to see how it works, but we intend to fix that _real soon_ **™**.
